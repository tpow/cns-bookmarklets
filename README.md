A collection of bookmarklets for the CampusNexus Student Web Client         

See the [Bookmarklets for CampusNexus Student Web Client](https://tpow.github.io/cns-bookmarklets/) web page for more information and to get the bookmarklets.

## Background
These bookmarklets were developed by Tim Powell at [Asbury University](https://asbury.edu/its) to help people switch to the [CampusNexus Student](https://www.campusmanagement.com/products/student-information-system/) Web Client from the desktop Windows application. Our power users complained that they missed their quick shortcut buttons from the CampusVue desktop application's custom toolbar. For example, they might have a button to take them directly to the Ledger Card. The quick link bookmarklet provides similar functionality from your browser's bookmarks.
